# Placeholder for blog post cover images

This directory contains cover images for blog posts. Each image should be:
- Named consistently (e.g., week12.png)
- Optimized for web (under 500KB recommended)
- 1200x630 pixels (Open Graph standard)
- PNG or JPG format

For the example posts, you can use any placeholder images or create simple ones using:
- Tool: https://placeholder.com
- Tool: https://placeholderimage.dev
- Your own graphics

Replace these placeholder references with actual images when deploying:
- week10.png
- week11.png  
- week12.png
