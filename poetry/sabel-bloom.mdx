i was alone  
noon light sliding in like it was scared to stay  
iron chair biting into me  
three apple slices on the plate  
edges turning rust  
softening into something almost sinful  

and i thought  
that’s your skin  
exactly  
the way it gives itself to air  
the way it darkens  
and still ends up sweeter  

people keep throwing the word beautiful at you  
like it’s enough  
like it could ever hold you  
they never see how you move  
slow  
certain  
like the last chess piece  
that knows it’s already won  

i see though  
i see the small things  
the half-second your lashes drop  
the way your breath catches  
when you think no one’s listening  
the tiny scar on your wrist  
that only shows in certain light  

you’re the moon  
wearing all your own clouds  
and i’m still here  
watching fruit go bad  
just to understand  
how something can rot  
and still be the most gorgeous thing  
in the room  

even if you were less beautiful  
(which you never could be)  
you’d still be  
so much beautiful  
it hurts  
to look  
directly  
at you
