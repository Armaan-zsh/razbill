4:T431,i was alone  
noon light sliding in like it was scared to stay  
iron chair biting into me  
three apple slices on the plate  
edges turning rust  
softening into something almost sinful  

and i thought  
that’s your skin  
exactly  
the way it gives itself to air  
the way it darkens  
and still ends up sweeter  

people keep throwing the word beautiful at you  
like it’s enough  
like it could ever hold you  
they never see how you move  
slow  
certain  
like the last chess piece  
that knows it’s already won  

i see though  
i see the small things  
the half-second your lashes drop  
the way your breath catches  
when you think no one’s listening  
the tiny scar on your wrist  
that only shows in certain light  

you’re the moon  
wearing all your own clouds  
and i’m still here  
watching fruit go bad  
just to understand  
how something can rot  
and still be the most gorgeous thing  
in the room  

even if you were less beautiful  
(which you never could be)  
you’d still be  
so much beautiful  
it hurts  
to look  
directly  
at you0:["bvYZrpfgEJW1rrYK5HSzr",[[["",{"children":["poetry",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["poetry",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},["$L1",[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-24 font-serif italic text-lg pr-4 relative z-10","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mb-8 not-italic font-sans tracking-tight","children":"poetry"}],["$","article",null,{"className":"space-y-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold not-italic font-sans text-foreground","children":"Sabel Bloom"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 whitespace-pre-wrap","children":"$4"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm font-sans not-italic text-muted mt-4","children":"— Armaan"}]]}],["$","article",null,{"className":"space-y-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold not-italic font-sans text-foreground","children":"Crimsonapple"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 whitespace-pre-wrap","children":"nothing ever happens\nand i still write to you\non the inside of matchbooks\non the steam of the mirror after showers\non the dark side of my pillow\nwhere no one looks\ni keep your name\nfolded small\nin the pocket of a coat\ni never wear anymore\nit’s soft now\nlike fabric that’s been washed too many times\nlike the memory of your mouth\noutside, the streetlights hum\nthe same tired song\nand every car that passes\nsounds like the one\nyou never came back in\ni light another cigarette\nwatch the smoke curl\ninto the shape of your shoulders\nit disappears\njust like you did\nslow\nquiet\nbeautiful\ni don’t want loud\ni don’t want answers\ni just want to stay here\nin this room\nwhere the air still tastes like you\nbreathing nothing\nfeeling everything\nnothing ever happens\nbut i still wait\nlike a song on repeat\nthat forgot how to end\nand if you ever walked back in\ni wouldn’t even ask why\ni’d just let the ash fall\nand say your name\nonce\nsoft\nlike a secret\nthe night already knows"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm font-sans not-italic text-muted mt-4","children":"— Armaan"}]]}]]}]}]],null]]},["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","poetry","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","styles":null}]]},[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","className":"__variable_9de95d __variable_c7e5dd","suppressHydrationWarning":true,"children":["$","body",null,{"className":"bg-background text-foreground font-sans antialiased selection:bg-accent selection:text-foreground","children":[["$","$L7",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mx-auto max-w-2xl px-6 py-12 sm:py-24","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"mb-20","children":["$","$L8",null,{}]}],["$","main",null,{"children":["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":"404"}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],"notFoundStyles":[],"styles":null}]}]]}]]}]}],null]],[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/razbill/_next/static/css/42a4fba4d18c81be.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":""}]],"$L9"]]]]
