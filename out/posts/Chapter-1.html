Iqbal’s parents came together in 1857. Sheikh Nur Muhammad was a middle class Kashmiri from Sialkot; his wife, Imam Bibi, was
also of Kashmiri descent. Nothing but an arranged marriage could have brought together such divergent personalities as these two, and
their long years of common happiness may indicate some extraordinary sensitivity in both.
Shiekh Muhammad Iqbal, their fourth child to survive infancy, is now generally thought to have been born on November 9, 1877
He was around two when leeches were applied to his forehead as a traditional remedy for some illness. This affected his right eye,
which became useless for the rest of his life. ”I never remember seeing anything with my right eye,” he was later going to report. Apart
from the obvious difficulty it might have caused in perception of distances, the dysfunction of one eye also became an impediment
when he later applied for civil service.
By the time he grew up and by all reports he was a very friendly child. Of course, he
excelled in recognizing the Arabic alphabet and learning the verses of the Quran by heart – almost the entire syllabus of his early
childhood education in a mosque school. He was a little above four when he met the person who changed the course of his life. This
was a vernacular teacher,&quot;Syed Mir Hasan&quot;.
Syed Mir Hasan was some sort of a social rebel and a staunch follower of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. He was also a supporter of Urdu, an
effective preacher in his own aloof manner and – what turned out to be most significant for Iqbal’s career
The mystic father had always dreamed of dedicating his younger son to the service of
Islam – which meant to him a religious education culminating in a lifetime of leading prayers in some mosque or serving a Sufi order.
Iqbal&#x27;s father&#x27;s plan shifted he enrolled in the Scotch mission school studying mordern subject through 12th grade before moving to
Lahore at age 18 By then his life transformed
As a child, he loved music and poetry. He delighted in bringing popular ballads from the market and reciting them to the women
in the house who were working till late in the night.
Before high school ended he mastered the poetics arts like Arooz (prsody) Abjad (verse numerlogy) chronograms and Ghazals plus calssical
indian music and later he could also play sitar</p>
<p>&quot;THE BACKLOG&quot;
In the first twenty-eight years of his life he appears as a natural poet growing up against a background of material progress and social
change around him while disappointments in personal life only prompt him to be, on one hand, more ambivalent about his poetic
talent, and on the other, more down to earth in his analysis of philosophical ideas.
The material progress was set in motion by the onslaught of industrialization and Western enlightenment in the wake of the British
subjugation of the sub-continent.
The post-enlightenment European concept of individualism was nowhere in the picture (except as a latent idea in the writings of the
great Syed, who was far ahead of his times in almost everything). The spirit of change and eagerness to participate in community
service in the Victorian sub-continent was seemingly based on the assumption that the individual had no identity save as a part of the
larger mass of people. This larger mass was the biraderi, literally meaning fraternity or community but also conveying a mystifying
awe to the Eastern mind – it was supposed to be the highest common factor to which the individuals must submit their ego, but quite
often it turned out to be the lowest common denominator. Also, one could belong to various communities at the same time. For
instance, Iqbal was a Kashmiri by caste, a Muslim by religion and a Brahmin by race (which last identity his ancestors forfeited when
they converted to Islam a few centuries ago).
Iqbal would denounce prejudice and bigotry, he would also preach to the individual to find salvation, not through annihilation in
God but through annihilation in the national ideals.
God, individual and the community was, in a way, the love triangle he had to deal with from the very beginning</p></div></div></div><footer class="mt-16 pt-8 border-t border-subtle"><div class="flex
