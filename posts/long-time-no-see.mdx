Hey, it's me back again. I know no one reads this—I just write it for myself. I really wanna be great in the future so I can look back and say, "I did it." (Enough motivation BS.)

This week—or this 2nd week—was absolute cinema. I didn't really focus on anything, but I learned so many things. I'll keep it short.

This week was all about learning. In life, there's this person I met—her, online. She's so great in every possible aspect. Not gonna lie, it's been about a year since we met. We fought, we came back again. This Nov/Dec, we both confessed that we like each other, but realized there's a fucking distance and so many hurdles in between. So we're kinda on and off about this, but still holding each other together. We made a promise: we'll hold each other till the end and see what God has planned.

So yeah, it's not the right time *or* the right person—it's both.

See ya next time.
