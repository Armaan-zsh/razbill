Sir Muhammad Iqbal, fondly remembered as Allama Iqbal, was born in Sialkot on November 9, 1877. 
He was educated at Sialkot and Lahore, and later at Cambridge. 
After receiving a doctorate from the Ludwig-Maximillian University at Munich in 1907 for his thesis The Development of Metaphysics in Persia, and bar at law from Lincoln's Inn in 1908, 
he practiced law for many years in Lahore, the city he had adopted as his home.

Dr.allam iqbal is not just a poet he is a well determined man who challenges evreything and beyond that and promises that
a human mind and his heart got so much potential but it's just a waste that human doesnt think anything about themselves
('Asrar-i-khudi") and just live a normal life and become a slave of their narrow mind and doesnt question anything

On the other hand Iqbal takes prode in being human and no desire to partake of the godhead of God.
To be god is to have concerns and worries that would give one a headache but to be human is to have that sweet pain called heartache

Iqbal's greatest concept  is the "Prefection" or rather limitless perfection is a frequent occuring motif in Iqbal's poetry
"I seek the end which has no end" This says Iqbal see no end to human potentialities he wishes humans to embark on a nevr ending journey of discovery

Unlike anyother poet in Islamic tradition: Iqbal enters into a dialouge with a god raising issues the orthodox would consider disturbing
He asks whether Adam's explusion from heaven has turned out to be Adam's loss or God own; he challenges God to speak to him 
face to face rather then through messengers and noting the discrepancy between the boundlessness of human ambition and limitedness
of the resources put at humans he asks God whether his expriment involving Adam is to be taken Seriously ?

Iqbal is too large a figure to fit any narrow procrustean category he demands and derserves attention on his own terms
Iqbal had a fine sense of the daramatic and in his poetry he frequently employs daramatic techniques many of his poems
are structured like a play with he first building a tension or a conflict that is resolved or raising a question that 
is answered in the second half for Example - ("Gabriel and Iblis") ("The Houri and the poet")
some poems are onsided dialouges or monolouges EX - ("Give me Adversary")

The eagle is Iqbal’s favorite bird, and the tulip his favorite flower.

This is just the beginning of understanding Iqbal—a man who dared to question, who refused to accept limitations, and who saw infinite potential in every human soul. 
In the coming parts, we'll explore deeper into his philosophy, his poetry, and the symbols that define his work.
