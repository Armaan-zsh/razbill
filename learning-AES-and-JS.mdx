hey this is 1/12/2025
it’s been a rough year for me at least
but i’m alive
weekly update time !!
this week i thought i figured out something insane about the tech — something that could flip everything upside down (but it’s gonna take years)
so like always, i opened my ai (the big 25B), dropped my diagrams and everything, and got a brutal reality check. the project i’m trying to build is a LOT fucking harder than i thought
proper rock bottom moment
started grinding JS and AES anyway. still don’t really know how to code, but i’m getting it slowly (not a CS major guy). my ass will figure this out 100%
turns out CS isn’t as bad as i thought, except it’s full of maths (which i totally hate btw). AES was brutal just because of the maths. JS on the other hand feels pretty smooth
that’s it. weekly rant over
