The Problem With Me
First and last problem that I will ever solve in my life to be the greatest ever
I'm going to keep it simple and straight—the problem with me is I have what I call "Compulsive Curiosity Engagement Disorder." Obviously this isn't a real disorder, I just named it for myself.
So basically, I'm the type of person who chases coolness instead of getting actual work done. Here's how it goes: I'm working on a project, right? Then suddenly I see an Instagram reel or YouTube video about cybersecurity or reverse engineering or whatever. And I'll immediately stop whatever the hell I'm doing and start doing what I saw in the video. Just because my brain finds it cool.
This is very bad, I guess. I can't focus on the one task I'm supposed to be doing. Recently I've been cutting off all my content and actually focusing on the work I'm really doing.
Or is it not my fault?
I don't think it's not my fault just because there's too much content out there. Yeah, there's a lot—but how much should a human brain consume? What to consume and what not to consume? That's what's more important.
So it's 99% my fault and 1% the fact that there's actually too much content out there.
I once saw a video where this guy was talking about MIT. He said when you get there, in the first 2 weeks you think there's too much to do. But in actual reality, you just have to find what is important and what is more important.
That stuck with me.
Enough ranting for today.
